# AutoHotKey scripts made by me
- [Fonts](https://github.com/ayes-web/Ahk-scripts/tree/master/Fonts), changes what unicode fonts you type in
- [Uwufier](https://github.com/ayes-web/Ahk-scripts/blob/master/uwufier/uwuV4.ahk) makes you type like a furry and has some more features like swear censor and easy kaoemoji putting
- [Ã¤ifier](https://github.com/ayes-web/Ahk-scripts/blob/master/%C3%A4ifier.ahk) makes all of your typed text have dots, lines and all of those weird symbols above them, it chooses random dotted variant of letter each time!
